      <div class="entry">

        <p>I finally buckled down tonight and fixed the mobile versions of my site. In all, it took around 4 hours minus the time it took for me to make some ramen and tea, because I want my styling to look as good as I can get it. I'm sure I will fidget with it, but for now it functions and I'm satisfied. With that said, I have a lot of styling to go over.</p>
        <p>I found that some things look fine just by adjusting the phone version, or the iPad version, so some of the media queries only have two instead of three. We will start with what I did with the header and footer.</p>
        <div class="codeBlock">
          <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border-radius:5px;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="border: 1px solid #FF0000">@</span>media screen and (max-width: 415px) {
  .myName {
    font-size: 25.5vw;
  }
  .navBar {
    <span style="color: #0000ff">float</span>: left;
    margin: 0;
    margin-left: 15px;
  }
  .navList {
    <span style="color: #0000ff">float</span>: left;
    font-size: 5vw;
  }
}

<span style="border: 1px solid #FF0000">@</span>media screen and (max-width: 350px) {
  .navBar {
    margin-left: 10px;
  }
}
</pre></div>

        </div>
        <p>I changed the font for my name to scale with the viewport, and found that 25.5% worked fine with both media queries, so I left it as is. The navigation bar needed a little tweaking with both phones and smaller phones (iPhone 5), with the margin being reset and slightly smaller on the latter, but I have it floating to the left so it fits under my name.</p>
        <div class="codeBlock">
          <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border-radius:5px;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="border: 1px solid #FF0000">@</span>media screen and (max-width: 415px) {
  .contactMe {
    <span style="color: #0000ff">float</span>: left;
    font-size: 5vw;
    margin-bottom: 0;
    padding-bottom: 20px;
  }
  .footer {
    padding: 0;
  }
}

<span style="border: 1px solid #FF0000">@</span>media screen and (max-width: 350px) {
  .contactMe {
    padding-left: 8px;
  }
}
</pre></div>

        </div>
        <p>The footer required a bit of tweaking as well, first by floating it to the left so everything fit. I changed the font size to scale with the viewport here as well, just to make it less specific according to sizes. The margin and padding were for added aesthetic.</p>
        <p>Now I'll move on to the more painful tweaking, on the home page's body.</p>
        <div class="codeBlock">
          <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border-radius:5px;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="border: 1px solid #FF0000">@</span>media screen and (max-width: 415px) {

  }
  .parallax {
    height: 700px;
    background-attachment: scroll;
    background-position: 27% 0%;
  }
}
</pre></div>

        </div>
        <p>I fixed my centerBottom class because the text over my picture looked absolutely disgusting on mobile. It was huge, and overflowed into the header so you weren't able to click any of the navigation bar items. I also changed the font to scale with the viewport, because the text was way too huge. With the parallax, I had to change it because on mobile it just zoomed in on my face and didn't move at all, so it's set to scroll now. I also fixed the position so the picture would actually show me instead of the background of the picture. Out of everything this section of the site was what I spent most on, because I couldn't quite get it how I wanted.</p>

  .myTwitter {
    width: 80%;
  }
}
</pre></div>

        </div>
        <p>I also fixed my Twitter feed a little bit by stretching it out a bit.</p>
        <div class="codeBlock">

    <span style="color: #0000ff">float</span>: none;

  }
}

  .aboutBody {
    padding: 0;
    padding-top: 10px;
  }

  .aboutPicture {
    max-width: 95%;
    height: 60%;
  }
}
</pre></div>

        </div>
        <p>My about section looked pretty nasty, but it was the second thing I tackled so I had more of an idea of what I wanted it to look like. I fixed the body so that it's centered and the padding as well, because the way I have it set up on desktop just squishes the text to the left side on mobile. The picture was overflowing off the right side so I had to fix the sizing and margin so it actually stayed on the page. The text is also scaled to the viewport now. For smaller phones I had to tweak the picture so it would look just right.</p>
        <div class="codeBlock">
          <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border-radius:5px;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="border: 1px solid #FF0000">@</span>media screen and (max-width: 1200px) {

  }
  .entry {
    font-size: 5vw;
  }
  .backToBlogs {
    font-size:7vw ;
  }
}
</pre></div>

        </div>
        <p>The blog section was super easy, because there weren't a ton of separate elements to fix. I tweaked the container around each post so it would fit nicely. I also changed all of the fonts so that they scaled well, but still held their weight in importance according to size. </p>
        <p>I put this off for way too long. I could've even done it in pieces but for some reason I felt the need to get it all done in one shot. Either way, I'm glad it's taken care of because having a responsive site is pretty important. Next time I make a website from scratch I will keep it in mind WHILE making it, instead of afterward. I'll be able to make it easier for myself next time, but I've learned now, and that's what's important.</p>
        <p>Also I swear I'll keep up the blog more consistently, I just haven't touched the site because of the looming dread of fixing the responsiveness. I'm not sure what's next for the site but I'll look through and see what I can add or fix.</p>

        </div>
        <p>I commented it in, but basically it just checks which page you're on by looking at the href of the page, and changes the pagination buttons on the bottom accordingly. I use a class called "active" to discern which link is active.</p>
        <div class="codeBlock">
          <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border-radius:5px;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">createA.addEventListener(<span style="color: #a31515">&quot;click&quot;</span>, () =&gt; { <span style="color: #008000">//Add a click listener to the anchors</span>

});
</pre></div>

        </div>
        <p>For this one, I added to the eventlistener that is already on the pagination buttons. It waits a tiny bit so when you click the button the page has time to change, and then runs the first function to check which link is active.</p>
        <p>I want to take this time to quickly go over something else I added, which is a way to view single blog posts by clicking on them. </p>

    });
  }
}

        </div>
        <p>Once I figured these two out I though I was in the clear, but not yet. I did some quick testing and found that when I would use my backToBlogs functionality, and then click the "Back to Blogs" button, there would be two pages highlighted.</p>
        <div class="codeBlock">
          <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border-radius:5px;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">backToBlogs.addEventListener(<span style="color: #a31515">&quot;click&quot;</span>, () =&gt; { <span style="color: #008000">//When you click on the &quot;Back to the Blogs&quot; div...</span>

    pageButtonsArray[1].className = <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;pageButton inflate&quot;</span>; <span style="color: #008000">//Reset the 2nd page button&#39;s classnames</span>
  }
  <span style="color: #0000ff">else</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">if</span> (window.location.href.indexOf(<span style="color: #a31515">&quot;#3&quot;</span>) !== -1) { <span style="color: #008000">//If you were on the third page previously...</span>

  }
});
</pre></div>

        </div>
        <p>I added a little bit to the backToBlogs eventlistener, so it checks if you were on the second or third page before you viewed a single blog post, and then resets the classes of the corresponding button.</p>
        <p>All in all these two functionalities kept me busy for almost a month. There was a lot of testing and hair-pulling, but I got them to work how I intended them to.</p>
        <p>I'm gonna need to put some last finishing touches on the website, and then it'll finally be live. I'll have to buy a domain and decide if I want to host it, or have someone else do it. Probably someone else.</p>

      <h1 class="realBlogTitle threeDText">A simple mistake</h1>
      <div class="entry">
        <p>So I've had a problem with my blog section on my personal website for a while... But I found the solution, and I actually facepalmed when the posts started loading. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57763177/pagination-will-show-first-page-but-not-second-or-third">Here's the link to my question for anyone interested.</a></p>
        <p>For anyone who's too lazy, I'll give you a TL;DR. I have this little function here:</p>
        <div class="codeBlock">
          <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
          <div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border-radius:5px;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000ff">function</span> showPage(page) {
          $realBlog.hide();
            <span style="color: #0000ff">let</span> postsToDisplay = [];
            <span style="color: #0000ff">for</span> (<span style="color: #0000ff">let</span> i = 0; i &lt; $realBlog.length; i += 1) {
              <span style="color: #0000ff">if</span> (i &gt;= page * postsPerPage &amp;&amp; i &lt;= page * postsPerPage + postsPerPage - 1) {
                postsToDisplay.push($realBlog[i]);
                $(postsToDisplay[i]).show();
                }
              }
              <span style="color: #0000ff">return</span> postsToDisplay;
            }
          </pre></div>
        </div>
        <p>Now, what it's supposed to do is loop through the blog posts according to the page you're on (the maximum posts per page is 10). So it makes an empty array and pushes the right posts into it, and then shows it. The problem is this little guy right here:</p>
        <div class="codeBlock">
          <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
          <div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border-radius:5px;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">$(postsToDisplay[i]).show();
          </pre></div>
        </div>
        <p>What I wanted it to do is show each post in the array. The problem is: why am I trying to show each object in the array, when I can just show the whole array? I don't know. The fix is this easy:</p>
        <div class="codeBlock">
          <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
          <div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border-radius:5px;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">$(postsToDisplay).show();
          </pre></div>
        </div>
        <p>It's always the simplest mistakes that cause the biggest issues, isn't it? I should know that by now.</p>
        <p>Anyway, I'm really satisfied now, and everything is working according to plan. I'm gonna do a final run-through of my site, and eventually migrate all of my posts here to my personal site. I'll add one final post here with a link to my personal site once I've finished migrating.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>In my Philosophy class last week, we had a discussion about who we would like to converse with for a day, and why. I chimed in that I would love to talk to Elon Musk and just see what kind of ideas for bettering humanity were running through his mind.</p>
        <p>My professor brought up that he heard Elon was an avid reader, as well as Bill Gates. He said that occasionally they talk about what books they're reading, and that gave me the push I needed to start reading again.</p>
        <p>I noticed that I needed a bit of a touch-up on my conversational skills, so I picked up How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships. So far, I'm loving it. I even used some of the tips today in my Philosophy class, funny enough. I wanna take a look later at Bill Gates' reading list, or what Elon Musk has been reading through lately, because those are two dudes that I really look up to. </p>
        <p>I also think I'll ask my dad too. He's my #1 role model. I hope to be like him, even though I've been told I kinda am already.</p>

        <p>Sorry for the lengthy hiatus. Life has been in the way and I'm just getting settled in to the college life. Why not hop back on the grind on Labor Day, right? </p>

        <p>So it works on the first page of posts, but not the second or third page... I finally got it together and just posted my question on StackOverflow because I don't want to look at it anymore. Hopefully someone more qualified can help me out.</p>

        <p>Anyway, I want to be more consistent again, although school will take priority over coding, so I'll do my very best.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>So I've been messing around with ideas and ways to actually have the blog on my site with JavaScript and I've learned 2 things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I should really learn a language for databases</li>
          <li>This takes a lot of trial and error</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I've seen easy ways to do it with PHP I just don't know if I wanna go down that route yet. That means a lot of it is going to have to be manually done (I know, you'd think I could make it do more for me). I want to automate as much of it as I can, but there's some things (like inserting each post onto an index page) that I'm just gonna have to do myself. Of course, I'll update things as I go. The website will never be "complete" I don't think.</p>

      <h1 class="realBlogTitle threeDText">My own blog ideas</h1>
      <div class="entry">
        <p>So I've been practicing my JavaScript on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codeacademy.com</a> and it's giving me some ideas on how I'd wanna tackle hosting my own blog. It'll require some sweet HTML, CSS, and JS all together.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use pagination, AKA restricting the amount of visible blog posts on the main page to something (5-10 posts).</li>
          <li>Using pre-made little HTML and CSS snippets to insert blog info onto main page, with each post having it's own page as well.</li>
          <li>Devise an easy way to write and post blog posts every day (hopefully), will probably require a basic template to start each post.</li>
          <li>Use some sort of array to hold a bunch of basic information for each post (Date, time, tags).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That's what I can think of, and what I'm gonna start with, but I'm sure there's more to it.</p>

      <h1 class="realBlogTitle threeDText">My website is almost complete</h1>
      <div class="entry">
        <p>I've been making big progress on the website in the past 2 days. Everything is really shaping up to be what I imagined in my head, so I'm really excited. I'm gonna dedicate this post to explaining what I've done to spice it up.</p>
        <p>We'll start with the home page. I found some cool fonts before I started making up my site, Libre Barcode 128 for my name in the top left and  Coiny for the navigation bar and footer. I don't think they really match, but 1) They look cool and 2) the 3-D effect looks great on both of them!</p>
        <p>The 3-D effect is just simple CSS text shadows. I've got a little inflate CSS attribute where when you mouse over navigation links, and it inflates them a tiny bit to show what's selected. One of my favorites is the parallax I set up with me in the background with my trumpet, which was a good amount of CSS as well.</p>
        <p>I haven't even started on any JavaScript yet.</p>
        <p>My "About" page still needs some work, but I have the basic positioning and design taken care of. It will let you download my resume though, so that's cool.</p>
        <p>I wanna do something that centralizes my blog onto the site, rather than having it on Wordpress, but I haven't figured out quite what to do with that yet. I want to give myself an easy way to write articles and add them, but that's gonna require some hefty JavaScript I think so I'll have to get cracking on that.</p>
        <p>I had to set up IIS to get my header and footer to work correctly. I have them as separate files, and use jQuery to insert them onto the page, but there was some sort of cross origin request problem so I had to set up IIS to fix it. That's not what I'll be hosting it from though, most likely it'll be through someone else, or I might host it myself with an Apache server. Not sure yet.</p>
        <p>I set up my Twitter timeline to show on the home page because I wanted to start using APIs again, and I've used the Twitter API before so I'm somewhat familiar with it (Thank you Teamtreehouse Fullstack JavaScript lessons). I think it's pretty cool to be able to see my activity on social media, and Twitter is the one I'm most comfortable sharing. </p>
        <p>My main concern is my blog idea. I wanna use it to kind of flex my JS skills, but I've gotta get back in the game before I can tackle something that large. It's been way too long since I've worked with JS, but there are so many resources online that I think I'll be able to handle it. I hope, at least. </p>
        <p>Ideally my site will be finished enough in the next few days. There's only a few final touches that need to be made before it can at least function correctly.</p>
        <p>Maybe there's more to do than I thought...</p>

        <p>So I've been tidying up my website for a few hours and it's really starting to shape up! I have to fill out my about page, and add a little extra flare for my blog, but so far so good.</p>
        <p>It's actually really satisfying to make progress. I feel like I've been stuck, but now I'm getting back in the groove. I'll give a detailed explanation tomorrow because I'm pressed on time, but it'll be on it's way. </p>
        <p>I still need to figure out what to do right now. Once I'm done with my website I'll be free to do whatever, so I'll have to look and see what my options are.</p>
        <p>Either way, I'm not dead yet, so stay tuned.</p>

        <p>I'm back on track now. I've been busy with life recently so I haven't had much contact with my computers. Now I finally have time though, so here's some updates:</p>
        <p>I finally got samba set up proper, and Subsonic as well. I've got my laptop and desktop connected to my shared samba folder, so that's pretty sweet. I'm currently downloading a 180 day trial of Windows Server 2019, so soon I'll have that to play with. VMs are looking pretty good, my Ubuntu server is running smoothly, so I'm excited.</p>
        <p>The plan is to use the laptop with my server on it to run VirtualBox and add the windows server to that, just to keep everything organized, and all the servers on one machine. Website looks pretty nice, I just need to set up hosting on Ubuntu, and snatch up a domain for it. </p>
        <p>In other news, I'm set for college. I'm getting a degree in Information System Management, which is apparently a business degree, and I've already attended orientation. I'm ready.</p>

        <p>I need to secure a copy of Windows Server 2018 R2. Then, I'll get Active Directory all set up, and go from there. There might be a way to do it with Linux on Windows, but I haven't done the research on that yet so I'm not sure.</p>
        <p>I did read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/c0zblq/antivirus_evasion_with_python/">this</a> post on reddit about evading antivirus using Python and Mestasploit, though.</p>
        <p>I haven't even touched any of my books yet :( but I will, maybe tonight. </p>
        <p>The website looks pretty good right now. I don't have everything set up, still need to fill up my "Contact" and "About" pages, but the home page looks fine. It's got a(n old) picture of me, my Twitter feed using their API, and a link to this blog here, but I wanna spice up the blog part a little bit. It'll require me to look back onto my JavaScript days a bit, but I think it's doable.</p>

        <p>So I've got some new stuff set up. Not a whole lab yet, but it's starting to take form.</p>
        <p><b>Desktop:</b> Kali Linux, Windows XP, and Metasploitable virtual machines through VirtualBox.</p>
        <p><b>Laptop:</b> Kali Linux virtual machine, through VirtualBox.</p>
        <p>I've also set up Ubuntu on a separate laptop to act as a server (I'm a weenie but I prefer the GUI), got samba set up, and connected my laptop and desktop to the shared file. It's more for personal use really. There's still more to add though, like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Build an Active Directory forest for your house</li>
          <li>Run your own DNS from Active Directory</li>
          <li>Run your own DHCP server from Active Directory</li>
          <li>Set up a proxy server</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thank you Daniel Miessler for your list on <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/build-successful-infosec-career/#gs.oEBcDP8">How to Build a Cybersecurity Career</a> for those, but also:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Host my own website from the server</li>
          <li>Add Subsonic for media streaming</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm still working on my website right now, so hosting is on the backburner for the time being, but it'll come soon. </p>
        <p>I'd actually also like to thank Jayson Street for suggesting I look at <a href="http://ir0nin.com/">iR0nin.com</a>, which has so far been a great resource for these first steps.</p>

      <h1 class="realBlogTitle threeDText">(Probably) A good start</h1>
      <div class="entry">
        <p>So I’ve collected a few PDFs of books with some simple google dorks (just use “filetype:pdf” after the title and try your luck), and also Amazon (thank you Amazon for free trials). I’ve also acquired a slightly used Kindle Paperwhite, and I’m ready to absorb some knowledge and ideally put it to use. Still pretty good at procrastinating, so that’s neat.</p>
        <p>I want to set up my lab either tonight, or Friday at the latest. I’ll stay up late if that’s what it takes. Gotta do some research on what exactly I should set up. I’m thinking probably Windows 7, Windows 8, Kali Linux, a Windows Server, maybe Ubuntu just because. Gotta set it up on my laptop too.</p>

      <h1 class="realBlogTitle threeDText">Here we go</h1>
      <div class="entry">
        <p>I have a couple of reasons to start this blog. First of all, I’m hoping it gives me a little extra push to work on my IT skills before, during, and after college. Also, to give me a medium to show findings, tests I’ve run, etc. But mostly the motivation part, because I tend to be really bad at that.</p>
        <p>Now that I’ve graduated High School, it kinda gave me a little kick to push myself and take some more initiative. Life’s about taking risks, right? Get out of your comfort zone and everything? Well here we are. This is my first step.</p>
        <p>I’ve found over the past few years that I’m the best at putting my thoughts into writing. It gives me a chance to revise and edit what I’ve got to say, so I can clearly communicate my thoughts. There’s another reason for this blog. It’s not even about people seeing the blog, I just want to be able to document whatever I feel, and hopefully in the future I can come back and take a look.</p>
        <p>So I have a couple goals for myself here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Get my CompTIA A+, CompTIA Security+, CompTIA Network+, and possibly CISSP certifications</li>
          <li>Read a LOT of books</li>
          <li>Get my lab setup on a desktop and laptop before I move into my dorm</li>
          <li>Continually update this blog</li>
          <li>Score a T1 tech support job on my campus</li>
          <li>Eventually move this blog onto my own site</li>
          <li>Get some new coding languages under my belt, and finally</li>
          <li>Enjoy what I’m doing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This list could grow and shrink, but at this moment, these are my plans for the future.</p>
